One library has been added, the "timeAgo" which presents the Last Active time in a user readable way. to install, go to the terminal in your project and cd to the Telemedicine-SPA/ directory and run this command:
'npm install time-ago-pipe --save' (no quotes)
and you should be good. if not he shows how its added in video 134 (section 13) so you can reference that

# User Role Information
Our user class contains a new field, UserRole of type UserRole. The UserRole class itself contains a field for a Role of type Role and a User of type User. The Role class contains a field called UserRoles which is a collection of type UserRole. This isn't super important information but shows the structure. The database relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, whatever) is defined in the datacontext. if you should need to know that stuff.

When a user registrates from our main registration screen, they are automatically assigned the role of "Patient" (AuthController.cs Register method does this).
We now have one admin account, username "admin" and password "admin" (which was automatically added when I "seeded" data after we drop the DB and re-add it.)
If you want to access the role for a particular user:
string Role = user.UserRole.Role.ToString()
this will equal either, "Admin", "Patient, or "Doctor" (doctor hasn't been implemented anywhere yet though)

Using this to customize the view for the role of the user is pretty simple, you can watch video 222 from section 21 (maybe 220, 223 too for angular stuff) 
The only part of this I have implemented so far is if you login as the admin you will have an "admin" tab at the top, but any patient user can not see that. We can remove the patient and doctor user tabs from the admin view the same way, and add a page to the admin view for registering a doctor, etc.

# Database information

You'll notice that the database looks different after adding the roles. Every table as "AspNet" before it and there are a lot of extra ones. the important ones are "AspNetUserRoles" which shows the userId and the Id of the their role. and "AspNetUsers" which is the usual user table.
